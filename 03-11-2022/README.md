1. WAP that creates 2 threads - each displaying a message (Pass the message as a parameter to the constructor). The threads should display the messages continuously till the user presses any key.
2. WAP using Synchronized Threads, which demonstrates Producer Consumer concept. Producer Consumer problem: The producer-consumer problem is the classical concurrency of a multi process synchronization problem. It is also known as bound-buffer problem. The problem describes two processes, the producer and the consumer, who share a common, fixed-size buffer used as a queue. The producer generates a piece of data, put it into the buffer and starts again.
3. WAP which will generate the threads: - To display 10 terms of Fibonacci series. - To display 1 to 10 in reverse order.
